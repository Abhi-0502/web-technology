        <p> We have built a project on Xylophone using Java and XML in Android. Xylophone originaly is an
            instrument played by striking row of wooden bars. This application will be implementing a
            xylophone link instrument that is capable of producing sounds. We will create few Buttons in
            this app that will act as key of the instrument when struck. This is going to be a single activity
            application.
